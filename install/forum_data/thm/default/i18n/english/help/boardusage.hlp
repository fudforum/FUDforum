TOPIC_TITLE: <a name="pmsg">What are private messages and how do I send them?</a> 
TOPIC_HELP:
If the administrator has not disabled Private Messaging system, you may send private messages to one or more registered 
members of the forum. To access the PM system, simply click on the <a href="{ROOT}?t=pmsg&%_rsid%" class="GenLink">Private Messaging</a> link 
which can be found at the top of the page's right corner. If you have any unread private messages, this link will indicate how many unread messages you have.
<p>
<b>Sending a private message</b><br>
Private messages are very similar to email, you specify the person(s) who you wish to send the message to, enter the subject & the message 
and click send. There are 2 links available, that would allow you to easily find members who you wish to send your message to,
<b>Select from Buddy List</b>, which will allow to select people from your buddy list, by listing all your buddies and <b>Find User</b>, which
will allow to search the forum's entire member list for people to whom you wish to address your message.
A copy of every sent message will be stored inside your <b>SENT</b> folder, for future reference, you can always delete those message should 
your choose to do so.
<p>
There are 3 other folders that you should be aware of:
<p>
<b>Inbox</b> folder contains any messages that you have received, each message has an read/unread indicator to allow you to see if you 
have read this message or not. You will also be able to see who sent this message and if that person is currently online or not, the date when 
the message was sent is also shown.
<p>
<b>Drafts</b> Folder contains the messages you have written but did not yet send yet. By clicking on the message you will go to edit mode, 
which will allow you to further modify the message as well as send it if you choose to. Once the message is sent it will be moved from the DRAFTS 
folder to your SENT folder.
<p>
<b>Trash</b> folder stores all the message you have marked for deletion, but did not delete as of yet. If you delete a message which is located 
inside TRASH this message will become permanently deleted.
<p>
<b>Message Tracking</b><p>
When you send a message you have the ability to request a read-receipt, when the recipient reads the message you will receive a system message 
notifying you that your message has been read.<br>
However, if you request such a receipt the recipient may choose to decline sending the read-receipt, so if you have requested a receipt and 
did not receive it this does not necessarily mean your message was not read.
