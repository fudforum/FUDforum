specifying one or more keywords you wish to be found and choosing where to find those keywords, you can either search in subject alone 
or do a full text search on both the message body &amp; subject. You can also limit your search to a forum of your choice if you do not wish to search 
in all the forums.<br />
You can also search for other forum members, by their login name or email address via the <a href="{ROOT}?t=finduser&amp;%_rsid%">user search form</a>.

TOPIC_TITLE: <a name="email">Can I email other forum members?</a>

To send a member and email, you can either find them through the member list page and then click on the <b>Contact</b> button

<br /><br />
In addition to sending emails to forum members, you can also use the <b>Email to friend</b> link to recommend a particular page to your friend 
by sending them a URL with the description. This link can be found on the topic &amp; message view pages of the forum.

TOPIC_TITLE: <a name="pmsg">What are private messages and how do I send them?</a> 
TOPIC_HELP:
If the administrator has not disabled Private Messaging system, you may send private messages to one or more registered 
members of the forum. To access the PM system, simply click on the <a href="{ROOT}?t=pmsg&amp;%_rsid%">Private Messaging</a> link 
which can be found at the top of the page's right corner. If you have any unread private messages, this link will indicate how many unread messages you have.
<p />
<b>Sending a private message</b><br />
Private messages are very similar to email, you specify the person(s) who you wish to send the message to, enter the subject &amp; the message 
and click send. There are two links available, that would allow you to easily find members who you wish to send your message to,
<b>Select from Buddy List</b>, which will allow to select people from your buddy list, by listing all your buddies and <b>Find User</b>, which
will allow to search the forum's entire member list for people to whom you wish to address your message.
A copy of every sent message will be stored inside your <b>Sent</b> folder, for future reference, you can always delete those message should 
your choose to do so.
<p />
There are three other folders that you should be aware of:
<p />
<b>Inbox</b> folder contains any messages that you have received, each message has an read/unread indicator to allow you to see if you 
have read this message or not. You will also be able to see who sent this message and if that person is currently online or not, the date when 
the message was sent is also shown.
<p />
<b>Drafts</b> folder contains the messages you have written but did not yet send yet. By clicking on the message you will go to edit mode, 
which will allow you to further modify the message as well as send it if you choose to. Once the message is sent it will be moved from the <b>Drafts</b> folder to your <b>Sent</b> folder.
<p />
<b>Trash</b> folder stores all the message you have marked for deletion, but did not delete as of yet. If you delete a message which is located 
inside <b>Trash</b> this message will become permanently deleted.
<p />
<b>Message Tracking</b><p />
When you send a message you have the ability to request a read-receipt, when the recipient reads the message you will receive a system message 
notifying you that your message has been read.<br />
However, if you request such a receipt the recipient may choose to decline sending the read-receipt, so if you have requested a receipt and 
did not receive it this does not necessarily mean your message was not read.

TOPIC_TITLE: <a name="mlist">Member List?</a>
TOPIC_HELP:
The member list is a complete list of all the registered users on a forum. 
You can sort the list in 3 ways: by login name alphabetically, by number of posts &amp; the date of registration.

TOPIC_TITLE: <a name="syndicate">Syndicating this forum</a>
TOPIC_HELP:
If permitted by the administrator, FUDforum allows you to syndicate a variety of forum data via XML (rdf). The RDF feed works primarily
in 3 modes, message retrieval, topic retrieval and user retrieval. Each mode of operation supports a number of modifier parameters that
will allow you to specify what sort of data do you wish to fetch. Below is the explanation of the supported parameters for each mode
of operation.<br />
