*****************************************
*	Installation Instructions	*
*****************************************

1) Copy the install.php script in to a web browseable directory.
	If you do not have safe_mode enabled it is a good idea to place the script in the same directory you intend to
	install the forum to. Otherwise, if you safe_mode is enabled, place the upgrade script in a directory that IS NOT
	the directory where you intend to install the forum.

2) This step applies ONLY to users who's PHP has a memory limit.
	Make sure that the directory the install script is in is either writable by the webserver 
	or that a "fudforum_archive" file exists and is writable by the webserver. The latter 
	applies only to users on servers WITHOUT safe_mode.
	
3) Using your web browser run the install.php script.	

4) The install wizard will then take you through 5 steps at the end of which you will have a working FUDforum installed on your server.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 checkout fud21_install

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 edit fud21_install

3) Enter the fud21_install directory, which was created by the CVS and run:
	php -q create_file_list install 1 >> install.php
   ** If your php was not compiled with zlib support, remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working install script, you can now begin the installation process by following
   the installation instructions above.

*****************************************
*	Uninstall Script		*
*****************************************

1) FUDforum distribution includes uninstall.php that will remove all files in a specified directory, 
presumably files created by a FUDforum installation. Because the installation may have failed the script
does not have any authentication in it. Which is why it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that it is not placed inside
wed accessible directories.
