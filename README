This package contains all the files required to install FUDforum, 
uninstall FUDforum, and to upgrade existing forum installations.

Install steps:
--------------
1) Copy 'install.php' and 'fudforum_archive' to a web-accessible directory on
   your web server.
	It is a good idea to place the script in the same directory where
	you intend to install the forum.

2) Run install.php from your web browser.

3) The installation wizard will guide you through five simple configuration steps.

Upgrade steps:
--------------
1) Copy 'upgrade.php' and 'fudforum_archive' to your forum's web directory.
   Tip: Upload them using your forum's 'File Manager' in the Admin Control Panel.

2) Run upgrade.php from your web browser.

3) After the upgrade, the consistency checker will launch.
   If it does not, you will need to run the consistency checker manually.
